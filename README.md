## Features

### Email Management

- **Delete emails** : Emails can be moved to trash for temporary deletion or permanently deleted.
- **Mark emails as read/unread** : Users can mark emails as read or unread to better organize their inbox.

## Project Architecture

### Backend

- **Node.js with Express** : The backend is a RESTful API that manages emails, drafts, labels, and blacklist.
- **Local storage** : Data (emails, labels, drafts) is stored in memory arrays, which simplifies development and testing.
- **Main endpoints** :
  - `/api/mails` : Manages emails (sending, receiving, deletion).
  - `/api/labels` : Manages labels (creation, modification, deletion).
  - `/api/blacklist` : Manages blacklist (addition, deletion, verification).
- **URL validation** : URLs present in emails are extracted and verified against the blacklist before sending.

### Frontend

- **React** : The frontend uses React to provide a modern and responsive user interface.
- **CSS Modules** : Styles are isolated for each component, ensuring easy customization and maintenance.
- **Main components** :
  - `Sidebar` : Allows navigation between folders and label management.
  - `TopBar` : Includes the search bar and dark mode toggle button.
  - `Mail` : Displays email details.
  - `LabelMenu` : Allows label management.
  - `ComposeWindow` : Interface for writing emails.

### C++ Module

- **Bloom Filter** : Implemented in C++ to efficiently manage blacklists.
- **Features** :
  - Add URLs to the filter.
  - Check if a URL is blacklisted.
  - Remove URLs from the filter.
- **Communication** : A TCP server allows the Node.js backend to communicate with the C++ module.
